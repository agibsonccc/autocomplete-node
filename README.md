autocomplete-node
==================

A node proxy for an auto completer implementation. This is meant to be an example webapp for comparision between the auto complete implementation in java and node. Currently, node doesn't load fast enough for the file, and I will be working on that in the future, so for now, please use the java version as a backend. This can be achieved with maven. Use the command:

mvn clean jetty:run

See: http://wwwconference.org/proceedings/www2010/www/p1249.pdf for 
an explanation.
